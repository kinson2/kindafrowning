Starting a business is hard. It takes knowledge, skills, and resources. You can do it!

1. **Buy your bricks and mortars wholesale.** Retail bricks are not cheap. Have you heard of brick flu?

2. **Stockpile as many bricks and mortars as possible for a future pandemic.** This way you can sell it to all those non-preppers and make a huge profit.

3. **Always lay your bricks first, mortar second.** You gotta lay the foundations of your business model.

4. **Don't allow for any online transactions.** That's the silent killer of the brick and mortar business.	

5. **Only accept cash payments.** Big brother and sister may be watching and charging card fees.

6. **Lock your doors on days when you don't feel like working.** Customers will forgive you for their confusion.

7. **Take no for an answer.** Better yet, only take questions. Alex Trebek would be so proud.

8. **The customer is always wrong.** That's why you're the business and they are the customer.

9. **Never post your open hours.** At some point, you'll have to change them and ain't nobody got time for that.

10. **Don't listen to other business owners' advice.** Make a diss song about them and play it as background music while your store is open...whenever that is.
